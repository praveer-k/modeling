Matrix Operations
===========================
Matrics are the fundamental tools in linear algebra. In this section, we will introduce some basic matrix operations.

Matrix Addition
----------------
Matrix addition is the operation of adding two matrices by adding the corresponding elements of the matrices. The matrices must have the same dimensions for addition to be possible. The result of the addition is a matrix with the same dimensions as the input matrices.

Say we have two matrices A and B, example:

Matrix A:

.. math::
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 2 \\
    3 & 4
    \end{bmatrix}

Matrix B:

.. math::
    \begin{bmatrix}
    5 & 6 \\
    7 & 8
    \end{bmatrix}

Then, the matrix addition is performed by adding the corresponding elements of the matrices A and B to produce the result matrix.

.. math::
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 2 \\
    3 & 4
    \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix}
    5 & 6 \\
    7 & 8
    \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
    6 & 8 \\
    10 & 12
    \end{bmatrix}
