Matrix Factorization
=====================

Matrix factorization is a class of collaborative filtering algorithms used in recommendation systems. The goal of matrix factorization is to learn the latent features underlying the interactions between users and items. These latent features are then used to predict the missing entries in the user-item interaction matrix.
